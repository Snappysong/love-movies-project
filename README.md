# WeLoveMovies Project

This project was made for users that needed suggestions for a new movie to watch. You could look up a movie by name and you could see where and when the movie would be shown near you. Also you can have the app suggest a movie to you based on genres.

This project I was mostly focusing on the back end. I had to made a backend server that validates the information being sent from the user facing UI to the actual database. We used Node, Express, and Knex mostly to validate information and send back the proper responses. Deploying this project was quite difficult and finding free hosting sites proved to be a challenge. 
## Goals

- Your backend must be a Node, Express, and PostgreSQL API.
- You must at least create, read, and update multiple resources within the application. The user stories in the final capstone will cover these requirements.
- Use React along with the API that you built as part of the final capstone.
- Your app must be responsive and work just as well on mobile devices as it does on desktop devices.
- You may use vanilla CSS or Bootstrap for styling the frontend.
- The styling on your client must be polished. In other words, you need to choose fonts and colors that make sense, correctly size the various components, and make sure that it looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.
- You must deploy a live, publicly accessible version of your application.
